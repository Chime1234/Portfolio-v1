                    <p>Hello! My name is Chinemerem and I enjoy
                        creating things that live on the<br /> internet.
                        My interest in web development started back
                        in 2018 when I decided <br />to try conjuring a website
                        from nothing into existence.</p>
                    <p>Since beginning my journey as a web developer nearly
                        5 years ago, I've done<br /> remote work for agencies
                        and collaborated with talented people to create<br />
                        digital products for both business and consumer
                        use. I'm quietly confident,<br /> naturally curious, and perpetually
                        working on being a Full-Stack developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JavaScript(ES5)</li>
                        <li>ReactJs</li>
                        <li>Node.js</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>
